# SCFA-FPS-1000
This mod increases the arbitrary FPS cap of Supreme Commander and the Forged Alliance expansion an order of magnitude from 100 FPS to 1000 FPS.

Actual FPS cap can be modified by changing '1' to the desired floating point frametime in milliseconds on line 2 of `hook/lua/ui/game/gamecommon.lua`.
